# aBot

I decided to make my machine learning assignment more intresting.How?Through using the Algorithm we learnt to solve real world problems.
This is why its under the whatsapp robot repo. Well lets switch things up . Whatsapp robots can the boring hey . Imagine chatting to your agent telling him you want to move out then the whats approbot replies hi , here is a list of rentals currently avalaible..................................................this is Joe i will get back to you . Like No Joe you ddnt answer the message why are you sending such a long irrelevent meassage .So what this code does is screens the messages by Learning messages sent to Joe and evaluating what the person wants from Joe and respondig accordingly . I have tested with 30 percent of the data and this proved to be 80 percent accurate which means we will only be annoying 20% with Joes irrelevent messages
